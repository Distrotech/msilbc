This package supplies the mediastreamer plugin for the iLBC audio
codec, which is necessary to use the codec with Linphone.  The package
does not contain the codec, which must be obtained separately.  One
way to get the codec is to also install libilb0-rfc3951, which
provides a codec using the source code published in IETF RFC 3951.

You can configure this package to use 30ms packets instead of 20ms.
Please #define USE_30MS_PACKETS=1 at compile time.  An easy way to
do that is to define MSILBC_CFLAGS="-DUSE_30MS_PACKETS=1" in the
environment when configuring.  Please see INSTALL for details.

Some VOIP providers such as Gizmo5 (aka Sipphone) require the codec
to be compiled with the 30ms second setting.
