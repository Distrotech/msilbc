This autoconf package installs the plugin into the mediastreamer
directory under /usr/local.  Please use './configure --prefix' to
change it.

For successful compilation, the package libilbc0-rfc3951 or similar
must be installed.  You need the shared library libilbc0 and the
pkg-config file with the build options. If you are using a package
manager to install libilbc0, please keep in mind that pkg-config
file could be located among development files.  In many distributions
those are in a separate package, such as libilbc0-rfc3951-dev.

This package makes it optional to use 30ms packets.  Some VOIP
providers, such as Gizmo5 (aka Sipphone), require the use of 30ms
packets.

To use 20ms packets, please run:

  ./configure

To use 30ms packets, please define the environment variable
MSILBC_CFLAGS="-DUSE_30MS_PACKETS=1" or invoke configure with:

  ./configure MSILBC_CFLAGS="-DUSE_30MS_PACKETS=1"

To compile, please run

  make all

To install, please run

  make install
