The package\r\ndoes not contain the codec, which must be obtained separately.  One\r\nway to get the codec is to also install libilb0-rfc3951, which\r\nprovides a codec using the source code published in IETF RFC 3951.\r\n\r\nYou can configure this package to use 20ms frames instead of 30ms\r\nframes.  Please #define USE_20MS_FRAMES=1 at compile time.  An easy\r\nway to do that is to define MSILBC_CFLAGS=\"-DUSE_20MS_FRAMES=1\" in\r\nthe environment when configuring.  Please see INSTALL for details.\r\n\r\nSome VOIP providers such as Gizmo5 (aka Sipphone) require the codec\r\nto be compiled with the 30ms setting.\r\n\r\niLBC and Global IP Solutions are trademarks of Global IP Solutions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
